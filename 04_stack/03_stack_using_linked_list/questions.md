2. Define a method is_empty() to check if the stack is empty in Stack class.

3. In Stack class, define push() method to add data onto the stack.

4. In Stack class, define pop() method to remove top element from the stack.

5. In Stack class, define peek() method to return top element on the stack.

6. In Stack class, define size() method to return size of the stack that is number of items present in the stack.
