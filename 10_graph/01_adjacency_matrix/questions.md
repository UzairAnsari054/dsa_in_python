Assignment-22: Adjacency Matrix implementation of Graph

1. Write a class Graph to implement adjacency matrix representation of a simple and undirected graph.

2. In class Graph, define ____init____ method to initialise vertex_count and adj_matrix (list of lists)

3. In class Graph, define add_edge() method add an edge in the graph with given weight.

4. In class Graph, define remove_edge() method to remove an edge from the graph.

5. In class Graph, define has_edge() method to check whether two given vertices are connected by an edge or not.

6. In class Graph, define print_adj_matrix() method to print adjacency matrix.
